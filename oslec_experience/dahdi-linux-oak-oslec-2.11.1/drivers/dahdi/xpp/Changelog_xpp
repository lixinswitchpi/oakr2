Sun Mar  1 2009 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r6795
  * Fix cases where the command_queue overflowed during initialization.
    - Also add a 'command_queue_length' parameter to xpp.ko
  * More migrations to sysfs:
    - Add a 'transport' attribute to our astribank devices which
      points to the usb device we use. E.g:
       /sys/bus/astribanks/devices/xbus-00/transport is symlinked to
       ../../../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.4/usb5/5-4
    - Move /proc/xpp/XBUS-??/XPD-??/span to
      /sys/bus/xpds/devices/??:?:?/span
    - Migrate from /proc/xpp/sync to:
      /sys/bus/astribanks/drivers/xppdrv/sync
    - New 'offhook' attribute in:
      /sys/bus/xpds/devices/??:?:?/offhook
  * PRI: change the "timing" priority to match the convention used by
         other PRI cards -- I.e: lower numbers (not 0) have higher
	 priority.
  * FXO: 
    - Power denial: create two module parameters instead of hard-coded
      constants (power_denial_safezone, power_denial_minlen).
      For sites that get non-standard power-denial signals from central
      office on offhook.
    - Don't hangup on power-denial, just notify Dahdi and wait for
    - Fix caller-id detection for the case central office sends it before
      first ring without any indication before.
      Asterisk's desicion.
  * USB_FW.hex:
    - Fixes cases where firmware loading would fail.
